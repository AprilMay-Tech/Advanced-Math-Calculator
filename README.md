# MATRIXMath-Calculator
This is a python program, so you may need to use certain commands to run the file index.py effectively. This is how I would recommend running the python program:

Bash (Windows, Mac)
python <filename>

Linux (Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Arch, etc.)
python3 <filename>

******MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYTHON3 INSTALLED FOR ANY LINUX USERS******

For this program to work well, use a linux distribution or a terminal on your operating system. THIS IS A PYTHON FILE. PLEASE read the license before looking at the file. I would recommend using this Windows Command Prompt tutorial (https://www.wikihow.com/Use-Windows-Command-Prompt-to-Run-a-Python-File) for Windows, this Mac Terminal tutorial (https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/run-python-script-terminal-mac) for Mac, and this General Linux tutorial (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/open-and-run-python-files-in-the-terminal/) to understand how to run this file successfully on your operating system. It is important to understand that every operating system has a different way to run the file, but most consist of the 'python3 {filename}' command, which is used in the Linux distribution I use, Kali Linux. I would strongly recommend any Linux distrobution that you could use OR Mac's terminal, both would work better than powershell (in my opinion).

This program is intended for you to use that benefits society, so please use it appropriately.
